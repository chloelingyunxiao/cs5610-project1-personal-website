**What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?**
I found the most challenging aspect of this assignment to be working with CSS’s grid and flex layouts. While these tools are powerful for creating responsive designs, they can sometimes conflict with established functions, leading to unexpected bugs that require careful troubleshooting. Additionally, I faced difficulties configuring the local localhost server and managing the discrepancies in deployment URLs on GitHub Pages. Specifically, the differences between absolute and relative paths can create inconsistencies in how HTML is parsed across different environments. Overall, I spent about 8-9 hours on this assignment, which involved a lot of trial and error as I worked to ensure that the layout functioned properly across different screen sizes.

**What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?**
To make my site mobile-friendly, I utilized @media queries to adjust the layout based on the screen width. Specifically, I implemented a design where, if the window width is less than 600 pixels, the navigation options collapse into a burger icon. This change not only saves screen space but also enhances the user experience on mobile devices by providing a cleaner interface that’s easy to navigate.

**What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?**
When developing the design of my website, I considered a cohesive theme using the Fluent UI design approach, which helped me maintain consistent colors throughout the site. Additionally, I utilized grid layouts for the project introduction section, which significantly improved the clarity and organization of the content. I am particularly proud of how these design choices enhanced the overall aesthetic and usability of the site, making it visually appealing while ensuring that information is easily accessible.

**Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?**
If I had more time or resources, I would love to enhance the email section of my site by adding functionality that allows users to click on the email address and automatically open their email client. Additionally, I would consider implementing an input box that enables users to send messages directly from the web interface. These features would streamline communication and provide a more interactive experience for visitors to my site.

**How many hours did you spend on this assignment?**
In total, I dedicated approximately 8-9 hours to this assignment, including the time spent on design, coding, and testing to ensure that everything worked smoothly.

**(Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they?**
One assumption I made about this assignment was that users would primarily access the site from mobile devices. This influenced my design decisions and prompted me to prioritize mobile responsiveness in the layout and navigation elements.
